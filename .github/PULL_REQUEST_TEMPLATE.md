## Summary
<!-- What changed, why, and how. Replace this comment with your actual description. -->
<!-- Example: 
## 🎯 What
Refactored the monolithic handleModalSubmit function in FileTree into a focused custom hook useModalSubmit.

## 💡 Why
- handleModalSubmit was 92 lines handling 5 distinct action types in one switch block
- Made the component harder to read and the logic harder to isolate
- Follows existing hook pattern (use-tree-keyboard-navigation.ts) for consistency

## ✅ Verification
- bun run lint — passes with 0 errors
- bun run build — passes with 0 errors
- No behavior changes — all validation, toast messages, and navigation-after-delete logic preserved exactly

## ✨ Result
- FileTree component reduced by ~70 lines
- Modal action logic now isolated in hooks/use-modal-submit.ts
- Easier to test and maintain in isolation
